\chapter{Introduction} 


Vehicle makes our life easier by bringing us travel convenience, 
but it also produces problems such as travel cost, carbon pollution, 
car accident and road congestion.
In 2015, about 140.43 billion gallons of gasoline were consumed in the United States. 
Also, according to the US Census Bureau, there are about ten million car accidents every year.
It has been shown that most car accidents are mainly 
caused by dangerous driving behaviors and human mistakes \cite{progressive}. 
These problems are caused by the lack of understanding, monitoring 
and careful control on vehicle dynamics. 
Better understanding and control on vehicle dynamics
can not only reduce car accidents \cite{progressive}, 
but also improve fuel efficiency \cite{morganstanley2013}. 


There has been active efforts to achieve better understanding on
human driving behaviors and better control on vehicles. 
One such example is to use driverless car system to 
replace human drivers \cite{googledriverlesscar, kumar2012carspeak,
urmson2008autonomous,litman2013autonomous}. 
However, it takes time for self-driving systems to be robust enough to 
replace traditional vehicles. 
Also, it is unlikely that self-driving
systems are going to ever achieve perfect accuracy under all
conditions.
Meanwhile, some researchers are using existing technologies to assists human drivers
in user-operated vehicles are more critical for safe 
and efficient driving activities \cite{you2013carsafe, wang2013sensing, chen2015invisible, uber}. 
Also, there are in-vehicle systems that assist human drivers with some driving functionalities, 
e.g., cruise control \cite{bengtsson2001adaptive, cruise_control} and emergence braking system \cite{emergency_brake} etc. 
However, there are many questions that have not been answered: 
what is the accuracy of smartphone sensors to capture driving behaviors?
how to assist human drivers to achieve fuel efficient and safe driving?
how to make self-driving systems more reliable? 


With many open questions in mind, we ask a high-level question in this proposal: 

\emph{how can we build sensing and control system blocks for modern vehicles to
monitor, assist or even replace human drivers in
improving driving performance and experience?}


To answer this question, we explore the sensing and control capabilities
of commodity hardwares and how to utilize them on modern vehicles. 
For example, we can use smartphone to sense and capture 
various driving behaviors, 
based on which we can evaluate driving performance. 
We can also access vehicle parameters from OBD 
port \cite{obd} to evaluate our driving behavior detection algorithms. 
We implemented a smartphone application called DriveSense to collect
data and verify our algorithms. 
We also present a control system called EcoDrive that 
leverages drive-by-wire technology to control fuel injection
rate to find a tradeoff between travel time and fuel efficiency. 
To handle occational self-driving system failures, 
we present a live streaming and remote control framework
called RTDrive to augment self-driving systems.

\setlength\itemsep{0em}


\item We illustrate that the accuracy of smartphone built-in sensors are very sensitive
to road conditions and human interactions when conducting driving analytics. 
Traditional slope-unaware approach may caused misalignment and acceleration over/under
estimation, which may cause significant sensing errors. 
We develop several techniques to identify the usability and accuracy of inertial sensors 
and improve their performance.  
We consider using commodity mobile device GPS receivers to sense vehicle
motion parameters, especially those related to acceleration and brakes, 
and evaluate the performance by more than 
10,000 miles of driving data. 
We find that GPS can be a good candidate to estimate such vehicle
motions, especially in high speed scenarios (higher than $10m/s$ or $22mph$). 
It indicates that GPS can be a good alternative than inertial
sensors due to its simplicity and better performance in high speed
scenarios.  
We develop DriveSense, an Android application component that can 
selectively use GPS and inertial sensors for driving analytics. 
A beta version of DriveSense has been released to 9 volunteers and this version has
currently recorded more than 3,000 miles of driving data in the last six months.
Our evaluation shows that DriveSense can improve the overall performance 
comparing with using either GPS or well-tuned inertial sensors. 



\item We design and implement EcoDrive, 
which is an independent fuel consumption sensing and control system
that can improve fuel efficiency. 
The system is implemented on an embedded platform 
that can be easily installed on regular vehicles. 
We model various vehicle forces as functions of instant fuel consumption
and the models are evaluated by utilizing 
10,000 miles of driving traces collected from 12 vehicles. 
EcoDrive is installed on a regular vehicle and evaluated by more than 100 miles of driving in both urban and highway environments, 
and demonstrated to improve fuel efficiency compared to cruise control system
of the vehicle and to human drivers.  




\item We design and implement RTDrive, a live streaming and remote control
framework, that can be used to view video stream and
control the vehicle remotely in real time. 
RTDrive can augment self-driving systems when they are
failed to percept the environment under various unpredictable conditions. 
It includes a context-aware video encoding algorithm,
which can encode video frames according to vehicle dynamics. 
According to the traces we collected, it is able to improve
the video encoding efficiency by 10\% to 30\% on average in 
various driving scenarios. 
It also includes a consistent-latency live streaming protocol,
which can adapt to wireless network conditions and buffer frames
for smooth display. 
It includes various modules such as bandwidth estimation, loss rate 
estimation, FEC encoding and frame buffering. 
According to a user study with 20 participates, 
the consistent-latency view algorithm improve the control
precision by more than 2x on average in a parking
task.
