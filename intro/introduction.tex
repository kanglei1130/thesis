\chapter{Introduction} 


Vehicle makes our life easier by bringing us travel convenience, 
but it also produces problems such as travel cost, carbon pollution, 
car accident and road congestion.
In 2015, about 140.43 billion gallons of gasoline were consumed in the United States. 
Also, according to the US Census Bureau, there are about ten million car accidents every year.
It has been shown that most car accidents are mainly 
caused by dangerous driving behaviors and human mistakes \cite{progressive}. 
These problems are caused by the lack of understanding, monitoring 
and careful control on vehicle dynamics. 
Better understanding and control on vehicle dynamics
can not only reduce car accidents \cite{progressive}, 
but also improve fuel efficiency \cite{morganstanley2013}. 


There has been active efforts to achieve better understanding on
human driving behaviors and better control on vehicles. 
One such example is to use driverless car system to 
replace human drivers \cite{googledriverlesscar, kumar2012carspeak,
urmson2008autonomous,litman2013autonomous}. 
However, it takes time for self-driving systems to be robust enough to 
replace traditional vehicles. 
Also, it is unlikely that self-driving
systems are going to ever achieve perfect accuracy under all
conditions.
Meanwhile, some researchers are using existing technologies to assists human drivers
in user-operated vehicles are more critical for safe 
and efficient driving activities \cite{you2013carsafe, wang2013sensing, chen2015invisible, uber}. 
Also, there are in-vehicle systems that assist human drivers with some driving functionalities, 
e.g., cruise control \cite{bengtsson2001adaptive, cruise_control} and emergence braking system \cite{emergency_brake} etc. 
However, there are many questions that have not been answered: 
what is the accuracy of smartphone sensors to capture driving behaviors?
how to assist human drivers to achieve fuel efficient and safe driving?
how to make self-driving systems more reliable? 


With many open questions in mind, we ask a high-level question in this proposal: 

\emph{how can we build sensing and control system blocks for modern vehicles to
monitor, assist or even replace human drivers in
improving driving performance and experience.}


To answer this question, we explore the sensing and control capabilities
of commodity hardwares and how to utilize them on modern vehicles. 
For example, we can use smartphone to sense and capture 
various driving behaviors, 
based on which we can evaluate driving performance. 
We can also access vehicle parameters from OBD 
port \cite{obd} to evaluate our driving behavior detection algorithms. 
We implemented a smartphone application called DriveSense to collect
data and verify our algorithms. 
We also present a control system called EcoDrive that 
leverages drive-by-wire technology to control fuel injection
rate to find a tradeoff between travel time and fuel efficiency. 
To handle occational self-driving system failures, 
we present a live streaming and remote control framework
called RTDrive to augment self-driving systems.

\section{Outline}

The rest of the thesis is organized as follows. 
In Chapter \ref{chapter_drivesense}, we present
our driving analytics system DriveSense, which leverages smartphone
sensors to monitor driving behaviors.
In Chapter \ref{chapter_ecodrive}, we present EcoDrive, an in-vehicle
system that can . 
In Chapter \ref{chapter_rtdrive}, we propose the live streaming
and remote control framework RTDrive, which can augment
self-driving systems upon occational failures. 
In Chapter \ref{chapter_relatedwork}, we compare our work with prior
approaches and systems to monitor, assist or even replace human
drivers. 
We conclude and discuss the avenues for further research in Chapter \ref{chapter_conclusion}.
