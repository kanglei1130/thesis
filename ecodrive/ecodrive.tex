\chapter{EcoDrive: A Mobile Sensing and Control System for Fuel Efficient Driving}
\label{chapter_ecodrive}

In this chapter, we introduces EcoDrive, 
a fuel consumption sensing and control system for modern vehicles, implemented
in an embedded platform, to improve fuel efficiency and reduce carbon emissions. 
EcoDrive senses vehicle dynamics
through the standard vehicle On-board diagnostics (OBD)
port and models various vehicle forces, i.e., propulsion, drivetrain loss, 
wind resistance and grade resistance, as functions of instant fuel consumption. 
By sensing vehicular speed and
controlling air/fuel injection rate in real time, EcoDrive can
adjust speed carefully to improve fuel efficiency.
We start with a background of vehicle system, followed by modeling
of vehicle dynamics and fuel consumption rate, and
then we will present a dynamic programming algorithm
to find tradeoffs between travel time and fuel efficiency.
