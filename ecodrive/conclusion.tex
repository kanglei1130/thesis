This paper introduces EcoDrive, a fuel consumption sensing and control
system that assists human driver to drive fuel efficiently. 
EcoDrive calculates driving strategy based on the properties of individual vehicles 
and road conditions. 
To this end, it models vehicle dynamics as functions of instant fuel consumption
and calculates acceleration strategies accordingly. 
We build a prototype of EcoDrive on a mobile embedded platform. 
The prototype is installed on a regular vehicle and
tested for more than 100 miles in both urban and highway environments. 
In comparison with human drivers, 
EcoDrive improves fuel efficiency by 10\%-40\% in urban environments. 
It has an average of 10\% higher fuel efficiency than vehicle built-in cruise control
and more than 30\% fuel efficiency than human drivers
on highway.
