This paper introduces RTDrive, a real-time live streaming and 
remote control framework to augment self-driving
systems upon occasional system failures. 
RTDrive consists of an Android-powered self-driving
and video streaming system and a server that can
display the camera view streamed in real time 
and send back control command to control the
vehicle. 
RTDrive includes some system modules 
such as video encoding/decoding, FEC encoding/decoding,
loss rate and bandwidth estimation, vehicle dynamics
sensing, as well as transportation protocols. 
Such a framework facilitate future research topcis such as
video encoding and streaming, video bitrate adaptations
in this application domain. 
Based on this framework, 
we design and implement several innovative mechanisms to improve
video encoding efficiency and user viewing experience.
We introduce a context-aware video encoding technique
to encode video based on vehicle dynamics, 
which improves video encoding efficiency by 10\%-30\%
through real world driving trace replay,
and consistent-latency to improve user viewing experience
by reducing lags, which improves user control
precision by 2x through user study.
