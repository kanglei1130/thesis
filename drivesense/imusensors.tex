IMU sensors are used in many driving analytics 
applications \cite{hansenspeed, wang2013sensing, chen2015invisible}. 
However, existing work assume the car is moving on flat 
roads and the smartphone is stably mounted in the vehicle. 
Different from these work, we propose several novel
techniques to improve the accuracy and usability of inertial sensors
by detecting orientation change, modeling stability,  
conducting slope-aware coordinate alignment and linear
acceleration estimation in a more practical manner. 
We design a slope-aware solutions to conduct 
coordinate alignment and track linear acceleration
by removing the gravity component dynamically from the aligned accelerometer readings. 
Second, we use clustering techniques to detect 
relative orientation changes. 
Third, we use moving variance to model the mounting
stability of the smartphone and evaluate sensing accruacy
based on mounting statiblity.

\subsection{Detecting Relative Orientation Change}

from a pocket and put on the car mount holder.

and put the phone into the pocket, which is also detected by MV method. }

Using inertial sensors to estimate vehicle motions
is also vulnerable to smartphone relative orientation changes. 
Relative orientation refers to the relative orientation 
between the smartphone and the car.  
When the smartphone is fixed in the car and 
the car is moving upslope or making turns, the
relative orientation of the smartphone does not change 
as there is no relative movement between the smartphone
and the car.  
The relative orientation is usually changed by the smartphone
user, e.g., moving the smartphone from pocket to the car mount
for navigation.



The gyroscope is able to track absolute orientation changes
of the smartphone \cite{zhou2014use}. 
Tracking relative orientation change is a different. 
Since the smartphone is moving at the same pace 
with the car (suppose the smartphone is mounted), 
the gyroscope will sense the steering motions of the 
car, i.e., making turns, driving upslopes etc. 
It is challenging to separate the movement of the car
and the movement of the smartphone itself. 


We find accelerometer can be used to reliably detect orientation changes. 
While the movement of the car will introduce noises accelerometer
readings, but the noises are relatively small ($1-2m/s^2$ in most of the cases) 
in comparison to the gravitational force sensed by accelerometer. 
Once there is an orientation change, the gravity components
sensed by accelerometer are changed dramatically.
During one test trip, we move the smartphone
from pocket to car mount holder. 
The accelerometer sensor readings are illustrated in Fig. \ref{example_change}. 
All the accelerometer sensor readings can be naturally
classified into three clusters. 
The upper small one is formed when the user hold
the smartphone and manually start the app. 
The rest two are formed when the smartphone is in 
the pocket and on the car mount holder, respectively. 
Intuitively, incremental clustering methods are reasonable 
choices to identify orientation change, 
i.e., there is new cluster formed. 


\textbf{Incremental Clustering}. Traditional incremental clustering methods can be used in 
orientation change detection, e.g., 
orientation change happens when there is another cluster
emerges. 
The existing clustering methods are reliable enough
and tested by many applications 
\cite{nguyen2015survey, ordonez2003clustering, rodrigues2008hierarchical, song2005highly}. 
We test several common incremental clustering methods 
such as Sequential K-means (S-KM), Hierarchical Clustering (HCA) 
and Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM). 
The drawback of such approaches is the delay for detecting
another cluster, i.e., it requires enough data samples
to form a new cluster. 
In some real time applications such as brake warnings, 
false warning may happen if orientation change
is not detected in the first place. 
Due to the space limit, We refer interested 
readers to \cite{nguyen2015survey} for 
detailed descriptions of different methods.


\textbf{Moving Variance (MV)}. To timely detect orientation change before
another cluster is formed, 
we look at the change of a moving window.
The moving window contains $m$ data samples, 
and we use the variance of the moving window to detect
orientation changes. 
The intuition behind is that the changes of sensed gravity components 
is much more significant than those of caused by vehicle's movements. 
The variance can be calculated as $Var(x) = E[(X - \mu)^2]$, 
where $X$ is the euclidean distance to the ``moving cluster''
center and $\mu$ is the average distance. 
There are cases that the movement is too small to be detected
by MV. 
For example, a small horizontal rotation of the smartphone will not 
change the variance. 
We use the stability model to estimate such small changes. 
We will show in the later section that such looseness
make the acceleration estimation inaccurate. 
 
 
\subsection{Estimating Mounting Stability}

Another factor affects the accuracy of vehicle motion sensing
is the mounting stability of the smartphone. 
The stability of the smartphone depends on how the 
smartphone is fixed/placed/held in the car. 
A good case scenario is the user placing the smartphone
on a stable car mount holder. 
A bad case scenario is the user or passenger playing
motion games such as car racing which requires rotating
the smartphone. 
The derived sensor readings of the car are over noisy
due to shaking and/or rotating of the smartphone. 


We model one fixed relative orientation as a cluster of 
sensor readings. 
We use \emph{intra-cluster variance (ICV)} to estimate 
the stability of the smartphone.  
A stable mounting of the smartphone is expected to produce a smaller
variance than unstable holding by hands.  
Since ICV is correlated with the cluster
size, we use the ICV of the subclusters to represent
the ICV of the whole cluster. 
We define one subcluster is any continous $n$ 
points of the whole cluster.  
We use ICV to evaluate the mounting
stability of the tablets from dataset $\#1$. 
We firstly remove all the trips that there is orientation 
change detected. 
As shown in Fig. \ref{mounting}, 
all the data from the 10 cars are naturally divided into two groups, 
where the first group (car 1-7) has a median variance less than 0.05
and the second group (car 8-10) has a median variance around 0.2.
We name the first group as \emph{tight group} and 
the second one as \emph{loose group}. 
Since the tablets are not aligned with the cars, 
we conduct coordinate alignment and linear acceleration
estimation by using the methods in Section \ref{slopeaware}. 
We compare the acceleration estimated by aligned accelerometer
and the groundtruth acceleration calculated by OBD speed. 
As indicated in Fig. \ref{mounting}, 
the estimated accuracy of the tight group is generally higher
than the loose group.
