\chapter{DriveSense: Practical Driving Analytics with Smartphone Sensors} 
\label{chapter_drivesense}

Sensing various driving behaviors, such as accelerations, brakes,
turns, and change lanes â€” is of great interest to many applications,
e.g., understanding drive quality, detecting road conditions, and
more. Many such applications rely on using smartphone placed in a
vehicle to collect such data for ease of deployment and use. However,
several driving analytics techniques in the recent past, including
our own, make simplifying assumptions that the smartphone is
stably fixed with certain orientation and the car is driving on flat
roads. Our deployment experience reveals that existing approaches
may cause orientation misalignment and acceleration over/under
estimation due to road slopes and human interactions, which lead
to significant sensing errors for driving analytics applications.
In this chapter, we present a smartphone app called DriveSense,
which addresses these challenges and conduct driving analytics
accurately by using various smartphone sensors.
